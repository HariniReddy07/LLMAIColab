OpenAI&;DeepSeek_API's
The LLM Parsing project is designed to process and analyze textual data using ChatGPT API (OpenAI) and DeepSeek API, enabling efficient text summarization, classification, and structured data extraction. The system takes an input prompt and processes it using both AI models, providing diverse and comparative insights. It ensures robust error handling, checking for authentication issues, API limitations, and response failures to maintain smooth execution. Designed for Google Colab compatibility, it offers cloud-based execution, making it accessible for various NLP applications such as academic research, business intelligence, content generation, and customer support automation. The project leverages dual-language model processing to enhance the accuracy and variety of AI-generated responses, providing users with high-quality outputs. However, challenges such as API limitations, model bias, and performance optimization remain, requiring continuous improvements, such as response caching and hybrid AI integration. Despite these challenges, the project successfully demonstrates the potential of LLM-based text parsing, offering valuable tools for research, automation, and business intelligence. Future enhancements can focus on expanding model support, optimizing performance, and refining output consistency for broader applications.

**Project Overview: LLM Parsing using ChatGPT and DeepSeek APIs**

The **LLM Parsing project** is designed to process and analyze textual data using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** powered by **ChatGPT API** (OpenAI) and **DeepSeek API**. This project enables users to extract meaningful insights, summarize content, and generate structured outputs from unstructured text data. By integrating multiple AI models, it ensures robust and diverse language understanding for various NLP applications.  

 **Objective**  
The primary goal of this project is to **parse, summarize, and analyze** textual data using **state-of-the-art LLMs**. The system takes an input prompt, processes it using two different AI models (**ChatGPT & DeepSeek**), and provides **parallel outputs** for comparison or further use in applications such as:  
- **Text summarization**  
- **Sentiment analysis**  
- **Content classification**  
- **Question-answering systems**  
- **Automated report generation**  

 **Working Mechanism**  
1. **User Input:**  
   - The user provides a **text prompt** (e.g., "Summarize the impact of AI on healthcare").  
   
2. **API Processing:**  
   - The **ChatGPT API** (by OpenAI) is used to generate responses based on its advanced NLP capabilities.  
   - The **DeepSeek API** is used as an alternative LLM to generate another response, providing a **comparative perspective**.  
   
3. **Error Handling & API Validation:**  
   - The system checks for **valid API keys** before making a request.  
   - It handles errors such as **invalid API key, model access issues, and rate limits**.  

4. **Response Generation:**  
   - Both APIs return **structured outputs**, which are then printed or stored for further analysis.
